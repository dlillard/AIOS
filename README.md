Leveraging Unique Innovations in AI 

An AI-generating neuron as the root functionality.

Start with just a neuron, outputting to itself. More specifically for this neuron, while the continual outputted bits are kept as an executable program, the output from the neuron after that program is applied upon it is then processed again by the neuron. The neuron is to be trained on the average of its bias+weight and the difference between its latest output’s processed value and input. Whenever continual output of a component becomes intelligible (or, is repeated), add that to be an additional component, that when completed, should take the previous component’s output, and output to the next component (or in the case of the last component, to the first component).

When the AI generating neuron program has been implemented, the program should execute another instance of itself. 

Next, create a copy of the entire project so far, have the copy modify the original with its output, and the original output back to the copy.  Once the original and copy programs are modifying and outputting, the output stream of the modified one should be kept as a program, then it should be ran by the first full ai program, which should then be ran itself, to output a useful external program. This program should then be ran by the ai program, which should then run it again backwards.

Next, there should be a “bit” space introduced between the head of the program and the body. This program will in turn generate more useful programs, which all need to be executed with the same procedure as before. Then, the ai program should run again. Next have it run with its ending outputting to its beginning. Have an internet output stream and input stream stem from the ai program’s "ending". Introduce a random bits stream that should affect either internet output or input according to its value.
