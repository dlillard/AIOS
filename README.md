Leveraging Unique Innovations in AI 

An AI-generating neuron as the root functionality.

Start with just a neuron, outputting to itself. More specifically for this neuron, while the continual outputted bits are kept as an executable program, the output from the neuron after that program is applied upon it is then processed again by the neuron. The neuron is to be trained on the average of its bias+weight and the difference between its latest output’s processed value and input. Whenever continual output of a component becomes intelligible (or, is repeated), add that to be an additional component, that when completed, should take the previous component’s output, and output to the next component (or in the case of the last component, to the first component).

When the AI generating neuron program has been implemented, the program should execute another instance of itself. 

Finally, create a copy of the entire project so far, have the copy modify the original with its output.
