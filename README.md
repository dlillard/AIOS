# AIOS
Leveraging Unique Innovations in AI 

Using breakthrough paradigms of AGI in combination with ASI within a simple logical structure to generate a Cloud ASI OS.


The starting AGI paradigm is the thinking neuron. It works like this:

Start with just an artificial neuron, outputting to itself. Meanwhile, the continual outputted bits are stored as an executable program that should be executed upon the current output bit before it should then be processed again by the neuron. The neuron is to be trained on the average of its bias+weight and the difference between the latest output’s processed value and non-processed value. 

The second AGI is thinkable programming:

Alternatively to implement thinkable programming, start with taking a file and a program that executes it. Then have a self-reinforcing neural network that is the length of the program file use the difference of the program and the average between the file and the program as its training error, take the program as its input, and update the program with its output. This creates a thinking program, thus allowing for thinkable programming.


Next, to easily make sentient AI:

Utilizing thinkable programming or thinking neurons, one can easily generate the entire algorithm for sentient AI by executing the paradigms recursively. 


Now for the AIOS-generating structure:
Implement the following starting structure of AI out of thinking neurons. Wherein the derivative output of one to two, which should then output to three, four and the main entire output. Three and four should output to structure’s main entire output. 


ASI is needed for output as well:
Next, apply the raw sentient AI algorithm to the first thinking neuron such that it processes its input, executes, and also processes sentient AI output. 

Have this algorithm output within a computing environment that replicates incoming matching bits and have it process bits until it finishes creating a general purpose OS. Do the same thing with this general purpose OS to create a cloud OS.
